# Stck Language Spec

The Stck language is defined by the following specification.

## Comments

Comments start with `#` and extend to the end of the line.

## Primitives

Stck uses two primary data types.

- Numbers. _e.x. `-1, 1.2, 4, 0`_
- Strings. _e.x. `"hello"`_

## Stacks

Stacks are the only data structure in stck. They are identified using a sequence
of alpha characters. They can be pushed to or popped from.

- `1>a`: Push value `1` onto stack a
- `a>b`: Pop from stack a and push value to stack b
- `a>`: Pop from stack a

Popping from an empty stack always returns 0.

There are two special stacks:

- Stack `i` is read only and contains the standard input.
- Stack `o` is write only. Values pushed to this stack are sent to standard output.

## Operators

In addition to popping and pushing, stacks can be manipulated with operators.

### Math: `+, -, *, /`

_In the following examples, addition can be replaced with any of the
mathematical operators._

Syntax: `stack+operand` or `stack+stack` or `stack+`

- `a+b`: Pop from a and b, perform addition, push the result to a.
- `a+`: Pop two values from a, perform addition, push the result to a.
- `a+4`: Pop from a, perform addition with the literal 4, push the result to a.

### Clear: `?`

Syntax: `stack?`

Clears the stack if the topmost value is 0.

## Functions

Functions are defined between curly braces.

Syntax: `{:name BODY}`

```
{:name
  # function body
}
```

When a function is called, the function body is executed. Functions can
only be defined at the top level of a program.

## Loops

Loops are defined between parens

Syntax: `(stack BODY)`

```
(n
  # loop body
)
```

A loop will execute until the stack is empty.
