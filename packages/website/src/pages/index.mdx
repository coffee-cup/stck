# Stck Programming Language

Stck is a minimal [stack
based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) [esoteric
programming language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language).
Data is stored on an unlimited number of stacks. Stacks can be pushed to,
popped from, or manipulated with operators.

Stck is heavily inspired by [Kipple](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Kipple). It also
takes inspiration from many languages on the [esolang
wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list).
