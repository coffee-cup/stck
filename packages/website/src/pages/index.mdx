# Stck Programming Language

Stck is a minimal [stack
based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) [esoteric
programming language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language).
Data is stored on an unlimited number of stacks. Stacks can be pushed to,
popped from, or manipulated with operators.

```
"Hello, World!">o
```

<ButtonLink to="/playground" primary={1}>Playground</ButtonLink>

## Getting Started

You can use Stck via the [online playground](/playground) or install it with NPM.

```sh
npm i -g stck
```

For information on the syntax, [read the spec](/spec).

## Usage

The `stck` command accepts a single filename as a parameter.

The following command will run the file example.stck.

```sh
stck example.stck
```

You can pass input to your program via stdin.

```sh
echo "1\n2\nworld" | yarn start examples/hello.stck
```

stdin is parsed and each line is pushed as a value onto the input stack (`i`).
Numbers are parsed as number and everything else is a string.

Stck can also be used programmatically with the `run` function. The second
parameter is optional and is the value of the input stack. The contents of the
output stack are returned.

```ts
import { run } from "stck";
run("i>o", [1])
// => [1]
```

## Example

If the you have the following program in `example.stck`.

```
"hello ">o i>o "
">o
i>a i>a a+a a>o
```

when run with the command

```sh
echo "1\n2\nworld" | yarn start examples/hello.stck
```

The output will be

```
hello world
3
```
